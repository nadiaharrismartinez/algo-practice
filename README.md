# Algo Practice

Hello!

This is just a little repo of some problems I've been working on in my AlgoExperts account.

Inside each problem you'll find some test cases and a few different solutions I came up with for that problem. The first approach is usually a brute force approach that doesn't take time complexity in account. The second or third solutions are usually my attempts at optimizing the space and time complexity of the original solution.
